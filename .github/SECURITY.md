# Security Policy

## Purpose
This document outlines the security practices and procedures for reporting and addressing vulnerabilities within this GitHub repository.

## Supported Versions
We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
|---------|--------------------|
| 1.0     | ✅ Supported       |
| < 1.0   | ❌ Not Supported   |

Security updates are offered only to the latest version. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest supported version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
We encourage responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities and are committed to resolving all valid security issues swiftly.

### GitHub Vulnerability Report Form
To report a vulnerability, **please use the [GitHub vulnerability reporting form](https://github.com/ScreamingQQ/Scratch5.0/security/advisories/new)**. This ensures your report is securely transmitted and reaches us promptly.

If for any reason you cannot use the vulnerability report form, you may alternatively contact us via email at [security@projectdomain.com] (replace this with your security contact email). Please include:
- A detailed description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Any known impacts or mitigations.
- Relevant logs, files, or screenshots.

### Response Process
- We will acknowledge your report within **24-48 hours**.
- Reports will be triaged based on severity and impact, and we’ll collaborate with you to confirm the issue.
- Critical vulnerabilities will be addressed as a priority, and a resolution timeline will be communicated.

### Confidentiality
- We request that vulnerabilities not be disclosed publicly until a fix is released.
- Reporters will be credited for their findings unless anonymity is requested.

## Scope
This Security Policy applies to:
- Code, configurations, and resources within this repository.
- Direct dependencies managed and maintained by this repository.

Out-of-scope issues include:
- Vulnerabilities in third-party packages or libraries (though we will assist in reporting them to their maintainers).
- User-specific misconfigurations unrelated to the repository’s functionality.

## Security Updates
Once a security vulnerability is patched:
- A new release will be published with a version number indicating the update (e.g., 5.2.1).
- A security advisory will detail the vulnerability, its impact, and the steps taken to address it.
- Users will be notified through release notes and/or repository announcements.

## Responsible Disclosure
We prioritize collaboration with the community to ensure the security of this repository. Responsible disclosure fosters trust and helps maintain a secure ecosystem.

We value and appreciate the effort you take to notify us of potential vulnerabilities, and we aim to make this process transparent and collaborative.

## Thank You
Thank you for helping us maintain the security and integrity of this repository. Your contributions protect the community and support the project’s success!
